# Peers-Lab
Repository of code files created while working as a Graduate Research Assistant for Dr. Graham Peers

Code files are mostly bioinformatics on algal strains, towards the overall goal of bioengineering improved algal strains for biofuel production.  
Bioinformatics tasks include codon optimization, analyzing transcriptome data, etc.
These data are incorporated to a genome-scale metabolic model, built by a previous student.  I am using this model in the COBRA toolbox to inform future metabolic engineering approaches.
